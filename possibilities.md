# Feature Suggestions for Personal Project Management

Since you're using this as a light personal project management application, here are some features that could elevate it from a simple "To-Do List" to a "Project Manager" without adding too much complexity.

## 1. Visualizations

- Kanban Board View: You already have a "3-step process" (Todo, In Progress, Done). A Board view would visualize this flow perfectly, making it easier to manage "Work In Progress".
- Timeline/Calendar View: A visual way to see upcoming deadlines and how strictures overlap. You have a detailed list, but a calendar view helps with planning.
- Organization
  Projects vs. Categories: currently categories seem flat. Introducing "Projects" (which could be a special type of category or a new entity) that track progress (e.g., "Renovate Kitchen: 45% complete") would be powerful.
  Tags: implementing a tagging system allows for orthogonal organization (e.g., #urgent, #phone-call, #errands) across different projects/categories.
- Task Richness
  Markdown Support in Descriptions: Allow bold, italics, lists, and links in the task description for better note-taking.
- Attachments: Ability to drag and drop images or small files into a task (e.g., sketches, receipts, screenshots).
- Checklists vs. Subtasks: Sometimes you need a simple inline checklist in the description rather than full-blown subtasks.
- Productivity Tools
  Pomodoro Timer: A built-in focus timer that links to the currently active task.
  Review Mode: A dedicated "Daily" or "Weekly" review interface to quickly triage pending tasks, archive old ones, and plan the next cycle.

## Automation

- Templates: Create task templates for recurring projects (e.g., "Packing List", "Weekly Review", "New Blog Post") that pre-fill subtasks.
- Stale Task Handling: (It seems you have some of this!) Enhance it to suggest moving stale tasks to a "Someday/Maybe" list.

## Gamification

- Streaks: specialized streaks for completing "High Priority" tasks.
- Leveling: Simple XP system based on completing tasks to encourage consistency.

### Recommended Next Step

I suggest starting with Kanban Board View or Rich Markdown Support, as these fill the biggest gaps for "Project Management" usage.
